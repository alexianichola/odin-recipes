        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This week is marathon week, so I’m focusing on foods made with wholesome ingredients that provide long-lasting energy to carry me through a full half marathon. One of my favorites is this <strong>Banana Chocolate Chip Muffin</strong>! I’ve been enjoying one before and after my long runs during training, and they’ve been the perfect energy boost.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter melted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup mashed banana about 2-3 bananas</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li>Mash bananas in a small bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Mix wet ingredients – In a large bowl, combine melted butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, 1 cup mashed banana, eggs, Greek yogurt, and vanilla extract. Stir until well blended.</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients – In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Sift and mix – Sift the dry mixture into the wet ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>Add chocolate chips – Gently fold in chocolate chips until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Prepare muffin tin – Line only the wells you’re using with parchment liners. Fill each lined well with about ¼ cup batter. For unused wells, leave unlined and fill halfway with water.</li>
            <li>Top muffins – Add a few extra chocolate chips and a sprinkle of flaky salt to each muffin.</li>
            <li>Bake – Bake for 10 minutes at 425°F (220°C). Without opening the oven, reduce temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake for another 15–20 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
